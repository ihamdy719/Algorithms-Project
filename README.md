**ðŸš€ LinkedIn Post: Project 2 & Project 7 ðŸš€**  

Excited to share two fascinating algorithmic challenges we've tackled recently!  

ðŸ”¹ **Project 2: Triangle Triplets**  
We explored how to efficiently detect triangular triplets in an arrayâ€”triplets satisfying the triangle inequality conditions. Our optimized solution not only finds if a triangular triplet exists but also counts all unique triplets and allows range-based searches for added flexibility.  

ðŸ”¹ **Project 7: K-th Element of Two Sorted Arrays**  
This problem challenges us to find the k-th smallest element in two sorted arrays **without merging them**. We implemented an efficient approach leveraging binary search to achieve optimal performance in O(log k) time.  

ðŸ’¡ These projects reinforced our skills in **algorithm optimization, problem-solving, and computational complexity analysis**. Always thrilling to push boundaries and refine our coding strategies!
